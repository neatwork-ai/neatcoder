Idea for an API service: Music Streaming Platform

The API service will provide endpoints for a music streaming platform, allowing users to interact with the platform's features such as user registration, song and artist discovery, playlist creation, and user song preferences.

1. User Registration and Authentication:
   - POST /users: Register a new user with their username, email, and password.
   - POST /login: Authenticate and generate an access token for a user based on their email and password.

2. Song and Artist Management:
   - GET /artists: Retrieve a list of all artists.
   - GET /artists/{artist_id}: Get detailed information about a specific artist.
   - GET /songs: Retrieve a list of all songs.
   - GET /songs/{song_id}: Get detailed information about a specific song.

3. Playlist Management:
   - POST /playlists: Create a new playlist for a user, providing a name and an optional description.
   - GET /playlists: Retrieve all playlists of the authenticated user.
   - GET /playlists/{playlist_id}: Get detailed information about a specific playlist.
   - PUT /playlists/{playlist_id}: Update the details of a specific playlist (name, description).
   - DELETE /playlists/{playlist_id}: Delete a specific playlist.

4. User Song Preferences:
   - POST /users/{user_id}/songs/{song_id}/like: Like a song for the authenticated user.
   - POST /users/{user_id}/songs/{song_id}/unlike: Unlike a song for the authenticated user.
   - GET /users/{user_id}/songs: Retrieve all songs liked by the authenticated user.
   - GET /users/{user_id}/songs/recent: Retrieve recently played songs by the authenticated user.
   - POST /users/{user_id}/songs/{song_id}/play: Update the play count and last played time for a song by the authenticated user.

5. Follow Artists:
   - POST /users/{user_id}/artists/{artist_id}/follow: Follow an artist for the authenticated user.
   - POST /users/{user_id}/artists/{artist_id}/unfollow: Unfollow an artist for the authenticated user.
   - GET /users/{user_id}/artists: Retrieve all artists followed by the authenticated user.

The API service will use authentication middleware to validate access tokens and enforce authorized access to protected endpoints. It will also implement error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios.
