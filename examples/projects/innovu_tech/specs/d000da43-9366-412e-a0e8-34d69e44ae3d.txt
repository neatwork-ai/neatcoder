Idea for an API Service: E-commerce Platform

Description:
The API service will provide functionalities for managing an e-commerce platform. It will allow users to interact with the platform by creating and managing customers, companies, products, and purchases.

Endpoints:
1. Customers:
- GET /customers: Retrieve a list of all customers.
- GET /customers/{customer_id}: Retrieve details of a specific customer.
- POST /customers: Create a new customer.
- PUT /customers/{customer_id}: Update details of a specific customer.
- DELETE /customers/{customer_id}: Delete a specific customer.

2. Companies:
- GET /companies: Retrieve a list of all companies.
- GET /companies/{company_id}: Retrieve details of a specific company.
- POST /companies: Create a new company.
- PUT /companies/{company_id}: Update details of a specific company.
- DELETE /companies/{company_id}: Delete a specific company.

3. Products:
- GET /products: Retrieve a list of all products.
- GET /products/{product_id}: Retrieve details of a specific product.
- POST /products: Create a new product.
- PUT /products/{product_id}: Update details of a specific product.
- DELETE /products/{product_id}: Delete a specific product.

4. Purchases:
- GET /purchases: Retrieve a list of all purchases.
- GET /purchases/{purchase_id}: Retrieve details of a specific purchase.
- POST /purchases: Create a new purchase.
- PUT /purchases/{purchase_id}: Update details of a specific purchase.
- DELETE /purchases/{purchase_id}: Delete a specific purchase.

These endpoints will allow users to perform CRUD operations on customers, companies, products, and purchases. The API service will ensure data integrity by enforcing foreign key constraints and validating input data.

Authentication and Authorization:
The API service will implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to certain endpoints. Only authenticated users with the necessary permissions will be able to perform sensitive operations such as creating or deleting entities.

Additional Features:
- Pagination: Allow users to retrieve a limited number of records per request.
- Filtering and Sorting: Enable users to filter and sort records based on specific criteria.
- Error Handling: Provide informative error messages and appropriate status codes for invalid requests.
- Validation: Validate input data to ensure consistency and prevent data corruption.

By implementing this API service, developers can build e-commerce applications on top of it, allowing users to manage customers, companies, products, and purchases efficiently.
