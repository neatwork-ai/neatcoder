4. PUT /customers/{id} - Update information about a specific customer.
5. DELETE /customers/{id} - Delete a specific customer.

6. GET /companies - Retrieve a list of all companies.
7. GET /companies/{id} - Retrieve information about a specific company.
8. POST /companies - Create a new company.
9. PUT /companies/{id} - Update information about a specific company.
10. DELETE /companies/{id} - Delete a specific company.

11. GET /orders - Retrieve a list of all orders.
12. GET /orders/{id} - Retrieve information about a specific order.
13. POST /orders - Create a new order.
14. PUT /orders/{id} - Update information about a specific order.
15. DELETE /orders/{id} - Delete a specific order.

16. GET /products - Retrieve a list of all products.
17. GET /products/{id} - Retrieve information about a specific product.
18. POST /products - Create a new product.
19. PUT /products/{id} - Update information about a specific product.

This API service would allow clients to manage customers, companies, orders, products, and order items. They can perform CRUD operations on these entities, allowing them to create, retrieve, update, and delete records as needed.
