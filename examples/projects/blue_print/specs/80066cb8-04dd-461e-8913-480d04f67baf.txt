Sure! Here's an idea for an API service based on the data model described above:

1. Customer API:
- Endpoint: `/customers`
- Functionality:
  - GET `/customers`: Retrieve a list of all customers.
  - GET `/customers/{customer_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific customer.
  - POST `/customers`: Create a new customer.
  - PUT `/customers/{customer_id}`: Update details of a specific customer.
  - DELETE `/customers/{customer_id}`: Delete a specific customer.

2. Company API:
- Endpoint: `/companies`
- Functionality:
  - GET `/companies`: Retrieve a list of all companies.
  - GET `/companies/{company_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific company.
  - POST `/companies`: Create a new company.
  - PUT `/companies/{company_id}`: Update details of a specific company.
  - DELETE `/companies/{company_id}`: Delete a specific company.

3. Order API:
- Endpoint: `/orders`
- Functionality:
  - GET `/orders`: Retrieve a list of all orders.
  - GET `/orders/{order_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific order.
  - POST `/orders`: Create a new order.
  - PUT `/orders/{order_id}`: Update details of a specific order.
  - DELETE `/orders/{order_id}`: Delete a specific order.

4. Product API:
- Endpoint: `/products`
- Functionality:
  - GET `/products`: Retrieve a list of all products.
  - GET `/products/{product_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific product.
  - POST `/products`: Create a new product.
  - PUT `/products/{product_id}`: Update details of a specific product.
  - DELETE `/products/{product_id}`: Delete a specific product.

5. OrderItem API:
- Endpoint: `/orderitems`
- Functionality:
  - GET `/orderitems`: Retrieve a list of all order items.
  - GET `/orderitems/{order_item_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific order item.
  - POST `/orderitems`: Create a new order item.
  - PUT `/orderitems/{order_item_id}`: Update details of a specific order item.
  - DELETE `/orderitems/{order_item_id}`: Delete a specific order item.

These endpoints can be implemented in Rust using a web framework like Rocket or Actix-web, and the data can be stored and retrieved from a database using an ORM like Diesel or sqlx. Additionally, appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms can be implemented to secure the API endpoints.
