### Dynamically scaffold entire codebases

1. **Define External Interfaces:**

Whether you're dealing with a database, an API, or any other external system, specify it so Neatcoder can integrate it seamlessly into the generated codebase.

2. **Describe Your Project Specification:**

Choose a programming language and provide a detailed description or specification of your project to let Neatcoder understand its structure, features, and requirements.

**Result:** Once done, Neatcoder not only scaffolds the entire codebase for you but also adds code streaming tasks to the task pool, ensuring you have a head-start in the development phase.

You can also access this feature via `Cmd+Shift+P` and write "Init Codebase".

### Code Streaming

As tasks are added to the task pool, you will be able to run them, and the Neatcoder will begin to write the code.

For enhanced productivity, you can also stream in the background while you write your own code.
